Quality comes first. As a client you have the right to expect high quality garments.Textile Sourcing bd will guarantee you that best-in-class quality assurance control is implemented in each of the factories that we are working with. Textile Sourcing bd  has established its own set of quality procedures and standards which we will gladly share with you. Should the client wish to apply its own quality standards we can easily accommodate to that request as well. Quality is built into the product in the first place. Quality cannot be achieved by inspection. Thats why Textile Sourcing bd ensures that the first fabric lot of every new order is tested at their in-house facilities as well as our facilities in the office. Once the approval is given the factory may proceed with cutting. Once the order has been completed, Textile Sourcing bd team of quality auditors will perform a final audit. Before shipment we will send a copy of the final audit report to you. If the clients requires, we will also send TOP (Top of Production) samples. These samples will be taken from the first pieces coming out of the lines and are immediately submitted to the client.

<p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;"><strong>Rules of origin:</strong><br/>
of the key advantages of sourcing from Bangladesh is the duty free and quota free access to the European Union under the EBA (Everything But Arms) initiative. The EBA has been created as special arrangements for LDCs (Least Developed Countries) and will be maintained for an unlimited period of time. Goods are considered originating from Bangladesh if there is sufficient working or processing. The normal proof of origin is the certificate of origin Form A. In general that means at least From yarn forward for knit From Dyeing Forward. When quoting the prices based on the base size sample, Textile Sourcing bd will also check with the factory and the Export Promotion Bureau in Bangladesh to ensure that the product fully complies with the rules of origin and a Form A can obtained.

<p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;"><strong>Compliance:</strong><br/>
The first criteria we select and evaluate factories on is compliance. All our factories need to be certified either by ourselves, WRAP, ETI, BSCI,OEKO-TEX or SA8000. Without such a evaluation, Textile Sourcing bd will not enter discussions on future cooperation. While these initial certifications are important and ensure that then factories  we approach are of a high level in terms of legal, ethical and environmental compliance Textile Sourcing bd takes pride in going one step further. In addition to the one-off compliance certifications, Textile Sourcing bd regularly conducts its own audits – at least every three months. Once upon a year we also request an independent audit firm to conduct a 3rd   party audit. These audits are conducted based on our internal compliance manual. Dont hesitate to contact us to learn more about Textile Sourcing bd Compliance policy. Should the client have an internal compliance policy, we will gladly incorporate them into our quarterly and independent annual audits. At Textile sourcing bd we believe transparency and upon request we will make all the certifications and audit results available to the client.

<p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;"><strong>Payment:</strong><br/>
Letter of Credits ( LCs ) at sight seem to be ubiquitous and must haves when conducting business with Bangladeshi companies. But after building the relationship with our clients, we may select the convenient payment method as per both parities convenience.
